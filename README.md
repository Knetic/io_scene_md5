# **Blender MD5 exporter**

Blender plugin that exports id Tech 4 MD5 meshes and animations.

## Installation

Copy to your Blender "addons" folder. In Linux, this is ~/.config/blender/scripts/addons.

## Usage

I've left the original manual for the addon included. It has guidance on how to set up your mesh / animation for export. 


## Wait, I've seen this code before!

Yes, this is a fork of the Arx "End of Sun" exporter for Blender 2.66, originally found at nemyax's post [here](http://www.katsbits.com/smforum/index.php?topic=520.0). I wasn't able to find it on Github (other blender md5 exporters are of Katsbit's exporter, which consistently would not work for me); and out of the interest to preserve and update the project, I'm forking it here. Full credit for the vast majority of this code goes to the Arx team, not me.
